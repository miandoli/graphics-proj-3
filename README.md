## Structure

Meshes are drawn, either a cube or sphere, and given a color. The shapes are rotated in a hierarchy to simulate a mobile or kinectic system. A spotlight with an option between smooth or flat lighting is used as well as an ambient light. Specular light is also used to add further detail into the lighting of the scene. Rotating in a hierarchy system by implementing a stack with the model view.
